# Transactional Machine Learning
*Transactional Machine Learning (TML) using Data Streams and AutoML is a platform that uses Apache Kafka as the data backbone* for advanced machine learning solutions using transactional data to learn from, and provide insights, quickly and continuously to any number of devices and humans in any format!

**TML Is Based On the Belief that "_Fast data requires fast machine learning_"**  
Forthcoming TML Book Details Found [here](https://github.com/smaurice101/transactionalmachinelearning_Book)

Apply auto machine learning to data streams and create transactional machine learning (TML) solutions that are:
 
 **1. frictionless**: require minimal to no human intervention 
 
 **2. elastic**: machine learning solutions that can scale up or down by controlling the number of data streams, algorithms (or machine learning models), and users of the insights

TML is ideal when data are highly erratic (nonlinear) and you want the machine to learn from the **latest** dataset by creating sliding windows of training datasets and auto creating **micro-machine learning models** quickly, that can be easily scaled, managed and the insights used immediately from any device!  **This is not possible with conventional machine learning methods that require frequent human interventions that create lots of friction, and not very elastic.**

Strengthen your knowledge of the inner workings of TML solutions using data streams with auto machine learning integrated with Apache Kafka.  **You will be at the forefront of an exciting area of machine learning that is focused on speed of data and algorithm creation, scale, and automation.**
